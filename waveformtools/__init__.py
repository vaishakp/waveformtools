"""
Module for the analysis and handling of numerical relativity and gravitational waveform data.

Classes
-------
sim: Base class for NR simulations data.
                This is needed to retrieve and handle Numerical Relativity data.
spherical_array:    A 2D data-type.
                    Stores and manages two-dimensional data on surfaces of spherical topology.
modes_array: A data-type.
             Handle and work with mode coefficients.
